Files encoded into DNA for the experiments are available inside subdirectory `data_files`. 
These were tarred and compressed with bzip2 and then encrypted using the commands listed in `encryption_commands.txt`.
We used separate encryption keys for the 1 CRC (`exp_0` to `exp_8`) and 2 CRC (`exp_9` to `exp_17`) oligos.

The text files encoded in our experiments consisted of:
- `gettysburg.txt`: The Gettysburg Address by Abraham Lincoln
- `mlkjr.txt`: "I have a Dream" by Martin Luther King, Jr
